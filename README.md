# Principles-of-Information-Security-CS8.401.S22

Assuming discrete log assumption (DLP) to be one way, do the following tasks -

- Build a provably secure PRG
- Build a provably secure PRF from PRG
- Use the PRF in some secure mode of operation to obtain a CPA-secure encryption scheme
- Use the PRF to build a secure MAC.
- Use the aforementioned CPA security and secure MAC to design a provably CCA-secure encryption scheme.
- Use DLP to build a a fixed length collision resistant hash function.
- Use Merkle-Damgard transform to obtain a provably secure collision resistant hash function
Use collision resistant hash function to build H-MACs.
- This list will be updated with more tasks later that will consist of the public key algorithms taught in the class.
- Programming language to be used - Python.

- Each task needs to be accompanied with 2 pdf documents along with the code -
A document consisting of the theoretical  explanation like idea, proofs etc
Another one consisting of the documentation of the code that you will submit.
